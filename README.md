This was my very first attempt to web development. 
I created a simple showcase website for a local business with a bootstrap template.
Note: i did not make the template, i just tweaked it to the customers needs and published everything with a static hoster.

What did I learn?

- basic usage of developer tools
- structure of a css framework
- how hard it can be to change things in bootstrap :D
- that i really like the visual (frontend) of web development
- how to handle customer requests

Is it perfect? NO! Was it fun? YES. Was it kind of terrifying? Yes.
Does it serve it's purpose? Yes!
